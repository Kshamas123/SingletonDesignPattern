Hereâ€™s a **README** for your Singleton implementation with multi-threading:

# **Singleton Pattern with Multi-Threading**  

## **Overview**  
This project demonstrates the **Singleton Design Pattern** in Java with multi-threading. The Singleton pattern ensures that only **one instance** of a class is created and shared across multiple threads.  

## **Project Structure**  
- `Main.java` â†’ Starts multiple worker threads.  
- `WorkerThread.java` â†’ Each thread attempts to get an instance of the Singleton.  
- `singleton.java` â†’ Implements the Singleton pattern.  

## **Key Features**  
âœ… **Lazy Initialization** â†’ Instance is created only when needed.  
âœ… **Thread-Safe Implementation** â†’ Prevents multiple instances from being created.  
âœ… **Multi-Threading Test** â†’ Demonstrates Singleton behavior under concurrent access.  

## **Expected Output**  
When you run the program, both threads should print **the same instance** of the Singleton class:  
```
singleton@1a2b3c4d
singleton@1a2b3c4d  <-- Same instance, proving Singleton works!
```
If **synchronization is removed**, different instances may be created, breaking the Singleton pattern.

## **Potential Issues**  
ðŸš¨ If `synchronized` is removed from `getinstance()`, multiple threads may create different instances, leading to **race conditions**.  

## **Possible Improvements**  
- Use **Double-Checked Locking** for better performance.  
- Implement **Bill Pugh Singleton** for an optimized and modern approach.
